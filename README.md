# React Hooks Identicons

A dynamic React component that creates an identicon based on a provided string. This library is based on [react-identicons](https://github.com/tuhnik/react-identicons) but was rewritten in React Hooks to avoid deprecation warnings.

## Install

With npm:

```
npm i --save react-hooks-identicons
```

With yarn:

```
yarn add react-hooks-identicons
```

## Usage

```javascript
import React from 'react';
import Identicon from 'react-hooks-identicons';

const App = () => {
    return (
        <Identicon string='user@example.com' />
    );
};

export default App;
```

## API

The following props are available:

|----------|----------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
